                <p>Is Thanos Right About Overpopulation In 'Avengers: Infinity War'? <br> <br>
                    We've all seen End Game (RIP) but let's go back to a previous film in the series. <br>
                    Bruce Banner discussed Thanos with Tony Stark, saying "He invades planets, he takes what he wants,
                    he wipes-out half the population.", now already
                    seems pretty bad, right? <br> Do you know the reasons why Thanos does this? <br> <br>
                    His home world explained that Titan, his home world, faced the problems over overpopulation
                    (starvation, pollution, collapse of biodiversity)
                    and he felt compelled to stop this happening to the entire cosmos, alongside y'know.. getting them
                    stones. <br> <br>
                    So we pass the question over to you, what do you think? <br>

                <p>Last month twitter user @RhysNathan posed the question "Why didn't they just ride the Eagles into
                    Mordor in Lord of the Rings?" <br>
                    Well, you all certianly had mixed reactions to this question, the amount of Sean Bean memes
                    dominated our Twitter DMs! <br>
                    We were sent a link to one specific Reddit
                    <!--Link it https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/6nysuy/lotr_classic_question_solved_why_did_the_eagles/-->
                    thread wrote 3 years and we couldn't word it any better.

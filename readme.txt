This is a website I used for the CodeNation Bootcamp.

This was my first proper attempt at creating a website, naturally not great but not terrible for a first time making website.
I definitely went div crazy!

I'm starting creating a website for a UK based brand of this website, it's called angrynerd.co.uk
